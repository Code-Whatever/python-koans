# The Ways of Python

Hello everyone! In this README file, I am going to help you understand how to solve Python koans. Before we start working on solving Python koans, we need to understand what Python is and what a koan is.

What we will discuss:
- What is Python?
- What is a koan?
- How do you solve a Python koan? - explain what to do

## What is Python?

Python is a back-end programming language that can be used for a wide range of tasks, such as data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and web development, just to name a few. Python has a very readable syntax that resembles plain English, making it easier to learn. If you wish to learn Python, I would recommand that you learn from the freeCodeCamp tutorial or from Harvard CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python. These are both great tutorials to get you started with Python and they are both on YouTube.

## What is a koan?

In the context of programming, such as Python, a koan is a series of exercises or puzzles designed to push programmers' understanding of the language's syntax, semantics, and problem-solving capabilities.

Here is an example of a koan that is written in Python:

```
import unittest


class TestKoan(unittest.TestCase):
    def string_koan(self):
        movie = "Ratatouille"
        self.assertEqual(True, isinstance(string, str))
        self.assertGreaterEqual(
            len(string), 3, "You must enter at least three characters"
        )


if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

## How do you solve a Python koan?

In the example shown above, we have a Python koan.

Before we worry about the koan, we need to import the unittest module, which will provide the tools we need to write unit tests. Next, we define a class named TestKoan that deals with the type of koan we are working with. Inside the class, we define a function that takes an input (self). Inside the function, we initialize a variable and give it a name and value. In the example above, we have a variable called "movie", and we assign it the value of "Ratatouille". After we have initialized the variable, the koan will check for two things: if the variable is a string, and if the variable contains at least three characters. If the variable does not contain at least three characters, an error will be raised.

After we create the koan, we need to run it. In Python, the code snippet if ```__name__ == "__main__": unittest.main()``` plays an important role in ensuring efficient and targeted unit test execution. It determines if the code can be executed based on how the code is written. If the code can be executed, it executes ```unittest.main()```.
