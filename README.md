# The Ways of Python

Hello everyone! In this README file, I am going to help you understand how to solve Python koans. Before we start working on solving Python koans, we need to understand what Python is and what a koan is.

What we will discuss:
- What is Python?
- What is a koan?
- How do you solve a Python koan? - explain what to do

## What is Python?

Python is a back-end programming language that can be used for a wide range of tasks, such as data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and web development, just to name a few. Python has a very readable syntax that resembles plain English, making it easier to learn. If you wish to learn Python, I would recommand that you learn from the freeCodeCamp tutorial or from Harvard CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python. These are both great tutorials to get you started with Python and they are both on YouTube.

## What is a koan?

In the context of programming, such as Python, a koan is a series of exercises or puzzles designed to push programmers' understanding of the language's syntax, semantics, and problem-solving capabilities.

Here is an example of a koan that is written in Python:

```
import unittest


class ExampleKoan(unittest.TestCase):
    def example_koan(self):
        string = ""
        self.assertEqual(True, isinstance(string, str))
        self.assertGreaterEqual(
            len(string), 3, "You must enter at least three characters"
        )


if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```
